## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the source code for BOJ problem recommendation system server, which provides APIs that the [baekjoon Bot](https://github.com/boaz-baekjoon/baekjoon-discord-bot) server can request in various user needs situations. The recommendation was implemented through a sequential recommendation model and a hybrid graph model combining Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Knowledge Graph (KG). These AI models were built with Pytorch and served with FastAPI. In addition, appropriate transformation was performed on the [pre-loaded PostgreSQL](https://github.com/boaz-baekjoon/baekjoon-celery-scraper-airflow) data and a data mart for the model server was built using duckdb.

## Data
Used the problem solving status and problem information data of silver level or higher users crawled from [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net/).
- user number : about 110,000 people
- problum number : about 30000
- interaction : about 17 million

## Recommendation Model

### SASRec
- SASRec is a classically used model in the field of sequential recommendation.
- Chose SASRec as a personalized recommendation model due to its parallel processing capability, efficiency in space complexity, and fast inference time.
- [The paper author's legacy tensorflow code](https://github.com/kang205/SASRec) was rewritten in pytorch.
- The default values ‚Äãfrom the paper were used as hyperparameters.


### KGAT
- KGAT is a hybrid graph model that models Collaborative Filtering information and side information as CF graph and knowledge graph, respectively.
- Used KGAT to generate item embeddings by appropriately using CF information and side information.
- Some typos and unnecessary operations were corrected in [the existing author's code](https://github.com/xiangwang1223/knowledge_graph_attention_network).
- For most hyperparameters, the default values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the paper were used. However, we reduce the embedding dimension and number of layers 
- As a result of the experiment, when the embedding dimension was low, loss was reduced better. Perhaps the recommendation problem we are trying to solve is expected to be at a low dimension.
